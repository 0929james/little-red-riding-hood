（Multiverse version: As Little Red Riding Hoodie sets out on her journey, she is unaware that the cunning Wolfosaurus, a wolf-like dinosaur with sleek fur and sharp teeth, has been trailing her from the shadows. Unlike the wolves we know, Wolfosaurus is larger, more intelligent, and possesses an uncanny ability to mimic the sounds of other creatures, making him the master of deception in this ancient world.

On her path, Hoodie encounters various dinosaurs, including the gentle Triceatops, which she feeds from her basket of goodies, and the playful Velociraptors, whom she outsmarts with clever tricks. These interactions not only highlight her kindness and wit but also subtly educate her on the dangers and wonders of the world she navigates.

The Wolfosaurus, intrigued by Hoodie's encounters, sees an opportunity to trick her when she stops to admire a particularly beautiful Apatosaurus grazing nearby. Mimicking the Apatosaurus' gentle call, the Wolfosaurus lures Hoodie into conversation. "Oh, noble creature," Hoodie says, "I am on my way to my grandmother's house, beyond the Silverfern River, under the shadow of the Great Crying Mountain."

Seizing the moment, the Wolfosaurus, still in disguise, suggests a race to see who can reach grandmother's house first. The naive Hoodie, full of youthful confidence and eager to share her grandmother's freshly baked fern cakes with the gentle giant, accepts, unaware of the creature's true nature.

As the story unfolds, Hoodie's journey becomes not only a race against the cunning Wolfosaurus but also a voyage of discovery, showcasing the rich tapestry of life that thrived in this prehistoric setting. Her encounters with the diverse dinosaur inhabitants of the forest teach her valuable lessons about trust, courage, and the importance of understanding the natural world around her.）
