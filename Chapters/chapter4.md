## Chapter 4: The Rescue

The wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightgown, lay in wait as Little Red Riding Hood stepped into the dimly lit cottage. She had just begun to sense that something was wrong when a loud crash echoed from the window. The wolf growled and lunged toward her, teeth bared.

But just as the wolf was about to strike, the door burst open with a thundering crash. The woodcutter, a tall, strong man with an axe in hand, charged into the room. Without hesitation, he swung his axe, driving the wolf back from Little Red Riding Hood and into a corner.

The wolf snarled, but it was no match for the brave woodcutter. With one swift and powerful blow, the wolf was defeated, collapsing to the floor. Little Red Riding Hood stood frozen in shock, her heart racing from the encounter.

“Are you hurt?” the woodcutter asked, his voice soft but firm.

Little Red Riding Hood shook her head, finally snapping out of her daze. “I’m fine,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “But my grandmother—where is she?”

The woodcutter nodded toward the wardrobe. "I heard a noise coming from there. Let's check."

Together, they opened the wardrobe doors, revealing Grandmother huddled inside, frightened but unharmed. Tears welled in Little Red Riding Hood’s eyes as she rushed to embrace her.

"Oh, Grandmother! I was so scared!" she cried.

Grandmother held her tightly. "I’m safe now, my dear, thanks to this kind man."

The woodcutter smiled modestly. "Just doing my duty. It's lucky I was nearby and heard the commotion. That wolf won't be causing anyone any more trouble."

Little Red Riding Hood wiped her eyes and looked up at the woodcutter. “Thank you so much. I don’t know what would’ve happened if you hadn’t come.”

With the wolf gone and the danger passed, the little cottage seemed to brighten, the shadows lifting as sunlight streamed through the window. The woodcutter took one last look around, making sure all was safe before tipping his hat and heading back into the forest.

As the door closed behind him, Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother sat down together, feeling grateful and relieved.

With the wolf defeated and her grandmother safe, Little Red Riding Hood realized how narrowly she had escaped danger. The events of the day weighed on her mind, and she knew she had learned an important lesson—one she would never forget.
